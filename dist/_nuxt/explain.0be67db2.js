The model is trained on data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey that is collected annually by the CDC. The prediction is based on the data you enter in the form. </p><p> De final prediction is based on 254.000 people who filled in the survey provided by the CDC. </p><h1 class="fs-title">How do we calculate the risk?</h1><p> When you have entered the data we will process the data on your local machine and run the data through our AI model. The model will then calculate a probability of you having a heart attack in the next 10 years. The higher the probability the higher the risk. The probability is a number between 0 - 1. We multiply the probability with 100 to get a percentage. </p><h1 class="fs-title">How do we calculate the tips?</h1><p> The tips are based on the data you entered in the form.
